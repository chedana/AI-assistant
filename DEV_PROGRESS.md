## Project Overview

Multi-turn conversational rental search assistant. Users describe rental requirements in natural language; the system extracts constraints, retrieves listings from a vector database, applies hard filters and soft ranking, and returns grounded explanations.

**Stack:** Python · FastAPI · LangGraph · vLLM (Qwen3-14B) · React + Vite + TypeScript + TailwindCSS · Qdrant · Sentence Transformers

_Last updated: 2026-03-01 · Branch: `restructure`_

### Architecture

```
User Input
  → [domain_router_node]     rental vs general conversation
  → [route_node]             intent: Search / AcceptSuggestion / Explain / QA / Page_Nav / DirectReply / Fallback
  → [apply_suggestion_node]  (AcceptSuggestion path) apply pending constraint relaxation
  → [search_node]            Qdrant retrieval + constraint extraction
  → [evaluate_node]          detect empty/sparse results; build pending_suggestion + proactive insight
  → [relax_node]             if sparse: relax bottleneck constraint, loop back to search
  → [skill node]             qa_plan → qa_execute | paginate | direct_reply | fallback
  → [finalize_node]          assemble reply text
  → SSE stream               FastAPI → React frontend

### What's working
- 4-stage search pipeline (retrieval → hard filter → soft rank → grounded explanation)
- Constraint extraction — rule-first engine covering budget, bedrooms, bathrooms, furnishing, let_type, tenancy, location (UK)
- Evaluate + relax loop — detects bottleneck constraint, relaxes it, reports sensitivity to user
- **AcceptSuggestion intent** — when assistant suggests a constraint relaxation, user can say "yes" and the graph applies it and re-runs search automatically (`apply_suggestion_node` → `search`)
- **Explain intent** — user can ask to explain any listing; routes to Stage D grounded explanation on demand
- **Proactive insight** — after every successful search, `evaluate_node` appends an insight (e.g. "raise budget £200 to unlock 12 more listings")
- **Budget headroom signal** — Stage C soft ranking rewards listings that cost well under the stated budget
- **Compare intent** — structured side-by-side listing comparison (markdown table + LLM verdict)
- **AreaCompare intent** — compare rental prices across multiple areas ("Is Hackney cheaper than Peckham?"); per-area Qdrant search + count/min/median/max stats table + LLM verdict; layout optional (note shown when absent)
- **Shortlist/Save intent** — users can save, remove, show, and clear listings by text command; deduplicates by listing_id/url; `metadata.shortlist` (count + saved_ids) sent in every SSE event for frontend card state
- Pagination — page up/down through full result set
- QA skill — answers questions about listed properties
- Domain router — separates Rental from General conversation paths
- Near-miss listings — shown in `ask_user` replies when strict search returns 0; display shows title + reason with actual listing value
- **CompareTable UI** — structured side-by-side comparison table rendered from `metadata.compare_data`; best-value green highlighting, clickable listing links, sticky field column; mutually exclusive with listing cards
- **Shortlist UI** — bookmark icon on each listing card (filled/outline driven by `metadata.shortlist.saved_ids`); click injects "save listing N" as chat message; clickable "Saved (N)" badge in header sends "show my shortlist"
- Frontend Phase 1 — component split (10 components, 2 hooks), hand-written markdown renderer, listing cards with preference/penalty tags, sticky constraint filter bar with ×-to-remove, quick-reply buttons, CSS thinking animation, backend metadata SSE event (search_results + constraints + quick_replies + compare_data + shortlist)
- SSE streaming — backend → frontend with stop-generation button
- Session persistence — localStorage + server-side TTL

### Not yet done
- General domain skill (`general_node`) is wired but responses are minimal
- No automated test runner — tests are JSON datasets validated manually
- UI Phase 2 (map view)
- `feature/rental` not yet merged up to `restructure`
- P2-B: location expansion when `prefilter_count == 0` (deferred — requires lat/lon data)
- Cross-session memory (preferences survive server restart)

## Changelog

### Phase 14 · Search pipeline fixes — S1/S3–S6/S8 (Mar 1)
> Branch: `restructure` | 2 commits

| Hash | Date | Type | Description |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| `dae333e` | 2026-03-01 | fix | S1/S3/S4 — tenancy filter redesign, rank_stage_c null safety, agentic null guard |
| `(next)` | 2026-03-01 | fix | S5/S6/S8 — remove dead signals, unify normalize, fix clause boundaries |

**Key fixes this phase:**
- **S1 — tenancy filter redesign** (`hard_filter.py`): extracted `_parse_months` from per-row loop to module level; corrected `op` label from `"ge"` to `"lte"` (listing's min tenancy ≤ user's max commitment); renamed check key to `required` (consistent with budget check); rewrote fail message to be human-readable.
- **S3 — null-safe Stage C return** (`soft_rank.py`): `rank_stage_c` now always returns `pd.DataFrame()` instead of `None` when input is empty — consistent type contract for all callers.
- **S4 — null guard in agentic** (`agentic.py`): `len(filtered)` gated behind `filtered is not None` check; `ranked_full` assignment simplified (never None after S3).
- **S5 — dead signal flags removed** (`signals.py`): removed `keyword_fallback_used` dict (always `{...: False}`, never flipped) and three always-empty debug arrays (`keyword_transit_candidates`, `keyword_school_candidates`, `fallback_tokens`) from `semantic_debug`.
- **S6 — unified normalization** (`constraint_ops.py` + callers): `normalize_budget_to_pcm` subsumed into `normalize_constraints` — one entry point handles all constraint normalization. Removed redundant post-merge normalize calls in `pipeline_service.py` and `agentic.py`; removed dead `normalize_budget_to_pcm` field from `ExtractDeps` and its property from `PipelineDeps`.
- **S8 — clause boundary fix** (`constraint_extraction.py`): replaced fragile step-2 loop over `cut_points` (broken when separator start/end coincides with 0 or len(src), producing odd-length list and misaligned pairs) with direct `zip(clause_starts, clause_ends)` over separator match objects.

---

### Phase 13 · QA pipeline rewrite — hybrid retrieval + LLM reasoning (Mar 1)
> Branch: `restructure` | 2 commits

| Hash | Date | Type | Description |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| `06ff89f` | 2026-03-01 | refactor | QA pipeline — hybrid BM25+embedding retrieval, LLM reasons over evidence |
| `6ce8ef9` | 2026-03-01 | fix | Deposit QA returns actual deposit value for single + multi listing |

**Key deliverables this phase:**
- **Deposit QA fix (B1)**: `answer_single_listing_question` and `answer_multi_listing_question` now return the actual deposit value (£0 / £amount / "ask agent") directly. Removed `__ASKED__` sentinel path that was incorrectly failing listings.
- **QA pipeline refactor**: Replaced `structured_lookup` + `semantic_vector_lookup` pre-labelling chain with:
  1. LLM structures question into need categories (`school_terms`, `transit_terms`, `general_semantic_phrases`) via `build_qa_context`
  2. Per-category hybrid retrieval: BM25 (TF-IDF, normalized 0–1) + embedding cosine similarity, combined with `max()` per chunk
  3. Category routing: school → `{schools, description}`, transit → `{stations, description}`, amenity → `{features, description}`
  4. LLM receives raw `listing_fields` + `evidence_by_category` and reasons to produce answer — no pre-labelling
- **B3 fixed**: `classify_qa_scope` fallback now uses `has_focus` / `last_qa_scope` instead of always returning `"clarify"`
- **Removed**: `pandas`, `_pick_decision_label`, `_structured_match_eval`, `_semantic_allowed_fields`, `_has_active_structured_constraints`, `SEMANTIC_HIGH_THRESHOLD`, `SEMANTIC_LOW_THRESHOLD` — 626 lines of pre-labelling code replaced by 266 lines of hybrid retrieval + LLM reasoning

**Architecture note:** `lookup.py` and `slot_extractor.py` remain on disk but are no longer imported by `handler.py`. Structured fast paths for deposit / furnish_type / let_type are preserved.

### Phase 12 · Shortlist Compare (Feb 27)
> Branch: `restructure` | 5 commits

| Hash | Date | Type | Description |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| `6d7036e` | 2026-02-27 | fix | Deposit compare formatter handles string values (£1,600, Ask agent) |
| `d34f3be` | 2026-02-27 | fix | NameError use_shortlist → wants_shortlist in compare_node |
| `830258d` | 2026-02-27 | fix | Update empty-shortlist compare message wording |
| `c530102` | 2026-02-27 | fix | Empty shortlist shows correct message immediately (not silent fallthrough) |
| `0fa71e8` | 2026-02-27 | feat | Shortlist compare — "compare my shortlist" uses saved listings |

**Key deliverables this phase:**
- **"compare my shortlist"** / **"compare my saved listings"** → `Compare` intent → `compare_node` uses `agent_state.shortlist` as the source instead of `last_results`
- All saved items are compared (no index selection — shortlist always compares everything)
- Empty shortlist → immediate message: "Your shortlist is empty. You need to have at least two listings to compare."
- Single item → "I need at least 2 listings to compare. Your shortlist only has 1 item."
- Router: 2 new few-shot examples for shortlist-compare queries
- Existing search-result compare behaviour unchanged

**Bug fixes in this phase:**
- `NameError` on `use_shortlist` (renamed to `wants_shortlist` but missed one reference) — crashed every shortlist compare attempt
- Deposit showed "—" in compare table because the field is stored as a string (`"£1,600"`) not a number. Fixed formatter to strip `£`/`,` before parsing; also displays "Ask agent" as-is rather than "—"

**Frontend note:** `AgentState.last_compare_source: Optional[str]` added (`"shortlist"` | `"results"`). Backend `build_metadata()` can use this to emit `compare_data` from `state.shortlist` when it's a shortlist compare, enabling the styled `CompareTable` component. Without this, the markdown table in the text reply renders correctly as-is.

---

### Phase 11 · Bug fixes — table separator row + AreaCompare constraint display (Feb 27)
> Branch: `restructure` | 3 commits

| Hash | Date | Type | Description |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| `7ae665c` | 2026-02-27 | feat | Show active filters line in AreaCompare output |
| `b058c2b` | 2026-02-27 | fix | --- separator row in markdown tables; AreaCompare layout override |

**Key deliverables this phase:**
- **`---` row bug** (`frontend/src/lib/markdown.ts`): separator-skip regex `[\s:-]+` didn't include `|`, so multi-column rows like `| --- | --- | --- |` were rendered as data rows. Fixed by adding `|` to the set → `[\s|:-]+`. Affects both Compare and AreaCompare tables.
- **AreaCompare layout override bug** (`orchestration/nodes.py`): layout extraction from the current user message was gated on `not _has_layout_constraints(base_constraints)`. If a prior search left bedroom constraints in the session (e.g. studios), "for 1b1b" in the current AreaCompare message was silently ignored. Fixed by always extracting from the current turn using `existing_constraints={}`, then merging only `layout_options` if found.
- **AreaCompare filters display** (`orchestration/nodes.py`): added `_describe_base_constraints()` which summarises all active constraints (bedrooms, bathrooms, budget, furnish, let_type, available_from, tenancy, min_size) as a dot-separated string. Every AreaCompare reply now shows a `_Filters: 1-bed · 1-bath · max £2,000/mo_` line directly below the title, or `_Filters: none — all property types..._` when nothing is set. Replaces the previous conditional "Note:" at the bottom.

---

### Phase 10 · Frontend — CompareTable + Shortlist UI (Feb 27)
> Branch: `restructure` | 2 commits

| Hash | Date | Type | Description |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| `b0f98d8` | 2026-02-27 | feat | Shortlist UI — bookmark button on listing cards + clickable "Saved (N)" header badge |
| `627abf9` | 2026-02-27 | feat | Structured CompareTable UI component for compare intent |

**Key deliverables this phase:**
- **CompareTable component** (`CompareTable.tsx`): responsive side-by-side comparison table rendered from `metadata.compare_data`; 8 field rows (price, beds, baths, deposit, available, size, furnished, type); best-value green accent highlighting; clickable listing title links; sticky first column; horizontal scroll on mobile
- Backend: `AgentState.last_intent` field + `build_metadata()` emits `compare_data` when intent is `Compare`; `CompareListingData` / `CompareData` types added to frontend
- Compare table and listing cards are mutually exclusive per turn in `ChatArea`
- **Shortlist UI**: bookmark SVG icon on each `ListingCard` (filled = saved, outline = not); state driven by `metadata.shortlist.saved_ids` set; click injects `"save listing N"` as user chat message (1-based page position)
- **Header badge**: clickable "Saved (N)" pill in app header; sends `"show my shortlist"` on click; hidden when count is 0
- `ShortlistMeta` type added to `SessionMetadata`

---

### Phase 9 · Shortlist/Save intent (Feb 27)
> Branch: `restructure` | 1 commit

| Hash | Date | Type | Description |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| `a1ea309` | 2026-02-27 | feat | Shortlist/Save intent — save, show, remove, clear listings by text command |

**Key deliverables this phase:**
- New `Shortlist` intent with `shortlist_action: str` (`add` / `remove` / `show` / `clear`)
- `AgentState.shortlist: List[Dict]` — cross-turn list of saved listing dicts; deduplicates by `listing_id` / `url`
- `shortlist_node` — handles all four actions:
  - `add`: saves by 1-based page position(s) from `last_results` (e.g. "save listing 2"); multiple at once OK
  - `remove`: removes by 1-based shortlist position(s) (e.g. "remove shortlist 1 and 3"); reverse-sorted to preserve indices
  - `show`: renders shortlist as a formatted list, or "empty" message with save instructions
  - `clear`: wipes all saved listings with count confirmation
- `metadata.shortlist` always included in SSE event: `{count: N, saved_ids: [...]}` — lets frontend show filled/empty bookmark icon without an extra API call
- `quick_replies` gains "My shortlist" button when shortlist is non-empty
- AreaCompare fix in same session: layout is now optional — comparison always runs, note added when no bedroom filter applied

**Frontend implementation:** Completed in Phase 10 (`627abf9`, `b0f98d8`).

---

### Phase 8 · AreaCompare intent (Feb 27)
> Branch: `restructure` | 1 commit

| Hash | Date | Type | Description |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| `ba2823b` | 2026-02-27 | feat | AreaCompare intent — geographic area price comparison with pending state |

**Key deliverables this phase:**
- New `AreaCompare` intent: "Is Hackney cheaper than Peckham?", "compare rents in zone 2 vs zone 3"
- `RouteDecision.target_areas: List[str]` extracted from LLM router; `GraphState.target_areas` stored per turn
- `area_compare_node`: per-area `run_search_skill(override_constraints={..., location_keywords=[area]})` → aggregate stats (count, min/median/max price) → markdown table + LLM verdict (2-4 sentences referencing specific figures)
- Like-for-like enforced: requires bedroom layout in constraints; if missing → asks broad layout question + stores `AgentState.pending_area_compare = {"areas": [...]}` for multi-turn resolution
- Pending follow-up: router receives `pending_area_compare_areas` context, routes "2 bed furnished" reply as `AreaCompare` (same pattern as `pending_suggestion` / `AcceptSuggestion`)
- Cap at 4 areas; no dependency on existing listings (independent Qdrant search per area)
- Layout extracted from user message on pending turn via `build_refinement_plan`; does not permanently modify `agent_state.constraints`

---

### Phase 7 · Compare intent + routing refactor (Feb 27)
> Branch: `restructure` | 2 commits

| Hash | Date | Type | Description |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| `1f5147b` | 2026-02-27 | refactor | remove `target_index`, unify all listing references on `target_indices: List[int]` |
| `4026e82` | 2026-02-27 | feat | Compare intent — structured side-by-side listing comparison with table + LLM verdict |

**Key deliverables this phase:**
- New `Compare` intent distinguished from `Explain` (holistic) and `Specific_QA` (attribute question)
  - `"compare listing 1 and 3"` / `"listing 2 vs 4"` → `Compare` → `compare_node`
  - `"which is best?"` → `Explain` → Stage D explanation (unchanged)
  - `"do listing 1 and 2 allow pets?"` → `Specific_QA` with `target_indices=[1,2]` → multi-target QA prose
- `compare_node`: Python-built markdown table of key fields (price, beds, deposit, available, size, furnished, type) + LLM 2-4 sentence verdict; operates on specific indices or all k listings if none given
- Router updated: `target_index` (singular) removed; all listing references now use `target_indices: List[int]` — `[N]` for single, `[N,M]` for multi, `[]` for none
- `qa_execute_node` gains multi-target path: filters `last_results` to specified indices before calling `answer_multi_listing_question`
- Frontend already renders markdown tables via existing `markdown-table` CSS class — no frontend changes needed for core feature; styling polish optional

---

### Phase 6 · AcceptSuggestion, Explain intent, proactive insights, Stage C improvements (Feb 26)
> Branch: `restructure` | 8 commits

| Hash | Date | Type | Description |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| `89ba320` | 2026-02-26 | fix | AcceptSuggestion negative few-shot examples; Explain query reframing; deposit ratio fix |
| `9eabdd2` | 2026-02-26 | feat | budget headroom signal in Stage C ranking — rewards listings priced well under budget |
| `9a0ff82` | 2026-02-26 | feat | Explain intent — on-demand Stage D grounded explanation for a specific listing |
| `a685ace` | 2026-02-26 | feat | proactive result insight appended after every successful search |
| `fa97fb8` | 2026-02-26 | fix | near-miss reasons now show actual listing value (e.g. £2,100/mo) |
| `8bdfd08` | 2026-02-26 | fix | simplify near-miss display to title + reason only |
| `439d08f` | 2026-02-26 | fix | show single clearest suggestion in ask_user reply |
| `e8922c8` | 2026-02-26 | feat | AcceptSuggestion intent — user can accept a suggested relaxation; graph applies it and re-runs search |

**Key deliverables this phase:**
- New graph path: `route → apply_suggestion_node → search` for one-click constraint acceptance
- `pending_suggestion` stored in `AgentState` after every evaluate pass (budget first, then highest-impact minor constraint)
- New `Explain` intent wired into graph; router updated with few-shot examples for both new intents
- `evaluate_node` now appends a proactive insight line to every successful search reply
- Stage C `soft_rank.py` gains a budget headroom scoring term (configurable via `settings.py`)
